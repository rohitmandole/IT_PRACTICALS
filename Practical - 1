    The junior college wing of M. J. Jr. College has been renamed as 'Swami Vivekanand Junior College' on the auspicious occasion of Birth Anniversary of Swami Vivekanand, on 12th January 2016. The motive behind this 'new identity' is to inculcate the principles of Swami Vivekanand among the youth (i.e. patriotism, educational perspectives, scientific devotion, etc).
